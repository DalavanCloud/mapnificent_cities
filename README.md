# Mapnificent cities

This repo contains data and meta data about all cities in [Mapnificent.net](http://www.mapnificent.net/). Metadata is stored in MarkDown files in the YAML Front matter and data is stored as Protocol Buffers in a `.bin` file.

## How to add a city.

In order to add a transit system to Mapnificent, [GTFS data](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) for that transit system needs to be available without charge under a license that allows its use with Mapnificent.

If the city is not yet in Mapnificent and please open an issue or – preferably – a pull request.

The issue will have a template that you need to fill out. The template is identical to the Markdown meta data.

If you can, please create a pull request where the markdown file is already named correctly. This will make adding this city more convenient and thus faster.
